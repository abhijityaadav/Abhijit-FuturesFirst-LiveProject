PAIR SELECTION






1.Pairs didn’t show mean reversion behavior using shortest Euclidean Distance as parameter. it might not capture direction and magnitude of of relationship between the assets  as  effective as other parameters


CADF P-value optimal range is not satisfied    (all p-value<0.01)
ADF P-value optimal range is not satisfied       (all p-value <0.05)
Hurst Exponent optimal range is not satisfied   (0<H<0.5)












  



  







2.Number of zero crossings


 Many pairs have high number of zero crossings but may  not optimal in Trading period      because of other parameters such as CADF ‘p’ ,value ADF p value ,hurst exponent etc
These pairs have high number of zero crossings but  pearson r and hurst exponent are out of optimal range


CADF P-value optimal range is not satisfied    (all p-value<0.01)
ADF P-value optimal range is not satisfied       (all p-value <0.05)
Hurst Exponent optimal range is not satisfied   (0<H<0.5)








  





  





3.Pearson r


  Pearson r identifies pairs that have strong historical relationships.it gives strength and direction    of collinearity between the pairs.we can establish correlation threshold for finding potential trading opportunity


CADF P-value optimal range is satisfied    (all p-value<0.01)
ADF P-value optimal range is satisfied       (all p-value <0.05)
Hurst Exponent optimal range is satisfied   (0<H<0.5)


These are the TOP 5 Pairs which have best potential among others pairs to Trade.
